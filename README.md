# Rawtek theme
A minimalist (almost brutalist) responsive WordPress theme.

You're free to use this theme on your site, but there's a but. It's quite tailored to our needs, with custom stuff deep in the code (which is bad, but since it's a brutalist theme we're doing things brutally all the way down). Therefore you'll likely have to change a couple of things, likely the waggling "saumon" (the French for "salmon") word in the headline. Don't worry, it shouldn't be too hard to tweak the theme since it's pretty barebones.

This theme is based on [```brutal```](https://github.com/mijustin/brutal-theme) by [@mijustin](https://github.com/mijustin/).

## Setup
This is a brutalist theme. Did you really expect any help ?

> ## “What if I have an issue ?”
Trick question ! I don't care about your problems.

> #### “You don't seem like a nice guy”
*Also called*
> #### “Open source is about helping each other”
Yes. But software development is a side-project of my life. *Open-source* development is a side-project of a side-project. Thus little side-projects like this theme are *side*-**side**-***side***-projects. So please don't feel entitled to lecture me about the values of F.L.O.S.S, thanks.
